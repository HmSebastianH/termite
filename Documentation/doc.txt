Workflow description 

This library uses default java annotations api and processor. Annotation processor handles annotations over the compilation phase before compiling source .java files.
We devide library workflow on 3 phases:
- Source code parsing and looking for annotated methods
- Deployment of the marked method as Lambda function into the cloud
- Creating smart invokers to get the intarfaces, that call appropriate functions

Deployment phase involves the folowing steps:

- Create the new file tree for every potential lambda function, solving naming issues.
- Generate Lambda Function code based on FaaS provider's programming model and method body.
- Generate input .java file, which porpouse is to be a PoJo for sending data to lambda function
- Fetch the external libraries from classloader
- Generate pom.xml for each lambda fucntion project including default libraries along with external
- Compile the project with the help of maven java invoker
- Read the credentials from default config file of the FaaS provider(Local OS)
- Use privider api to create lambda function in the cloud
- Write all output into the the log file

Invokers creating phase is not implemented yet, but the idea will be discribed below:

Synchronous invocation of function works through the HTTP(API Gateway for AWS). AWS provides library to execute function with your java code.
So far lambda function is implemented without responding and the idea for invoker is to run it a new thread to prevent stoping of the main thread.
Invoker should create input type instance, initialize it and send it to appropriate lambda function thereby calling the function.
